 * @brief Used when scheduling work to inform the `GWBManager` how to treat this unit of work.
 * The important fields are `Priority`, `MaxDelay, and `MaxNumSkippedFrames`... if these are defined
 * the manager will force fire the work unit to do work if those are exceeded. This allows you to schedule work that
 * has an effective maximum delay before it's done even if it causes frame hitches.
